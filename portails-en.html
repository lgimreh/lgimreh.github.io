      <h3>THE PROJECT</h3>
      <p class="body">The project is located on an abandoned railway lot in the Limoilou neighborhood of Québec. Vegetation has taken over the land, resulting in a “third landscape” used by the neighborhood's residents. This site includes both accessible beaten paths and dense areas of vegetation. The workshop’s goal was to create a shared place of worship using the potential of 3D printed concrete. The project's main idea was therefore to mark this natural site with a dispersed architectural intervention, which highlights the smallness of the visitor in the face of the uncaring nature through which they tread: this realization brings about moments of great spiritual potential.</p>
      <p class="body">A logic of gradients was used in every aspect of the project, first in its choice of location: based on a map of vegetation densities from our site survey, a linear path was isolated, going from an accessible environment (green) to a dense and secluded area (red). Four pavilions were placed at each degree of density along the path, ranging from a common space for celebrations to an intimate place for individual prayer or meditation.</p>
      <p class="body">The shape of each pavilion is inspired by the defining features of the atmosphere of the different environments along the path in order to bring the latter to light.</p>

  <h2>THE PATH</h2>
  <p class="middle">The first sight one has of the project presents itself purely as a cavernous form opening up before the visitor.</p>

  <img class="fit" src="assets/portails/1-VUE2.jpg">
  <img class="fit" src="assets/portails/1-VUE3.jpg">
  <p class="middle">The first pavilion resembles a sort of cloister, centered around a common platform, in dialogue with the canopy above.</p>

  <img class="fit" src="assets/portails/2-VUE2.jpg">
  <img class="fit" src="assets/portails/2-VUE3.jpg">
  <p class="middle">The second pavilion is divided into two spaces, one open to the forest and the other more cavernous, framing views on the nearby swamp.</p>
  <img class="fit" src="assets/portails/3-SENTIER1.jpg">
  <img class="fit" src="assets/portails/3-VUE1.jpg">
  <p class="middle">Hidden among the plants of the swamp, the third space is the only one without walls. Its 'topography' makes it accessible to only two visitors, for intimate discussions.</p>
  <img class="fit" src="assets/portails/4-SENTIER1.jpg">
  <img class="fit" src="assets/portails/4-VUE1.jpg">
  <p class="middle">The last space is located in a dense underbrush. Separated from the outside world by this vegetation, the visitor can meditate in peace.</p>
